Assignment 1

 

Write a C program to test the uniformity of the distribution of numbers generated by the C library function rand().

Prompt the user the number of intervals to divide the range 0 to RAND_MAX into, and then prompt the user for how many random numbers to generate.

Call rand() to generate the requested number of random numbers, incrementing a counter for each interval into which a generated number falls.

Then compute the average and the standard deviation (both doubles) of the counts corresponding to the intervals. Implement your computation of the average and standard deviation as functions, each of which return a double result. Print the average and standard deviation in an informational manner.

Your code should consist of one source C file. Name your sourcefile main.c and email it to the instructor as an attachment (do not paste it into the body of the message) before class before class on Thursday, January 21st.. Please include "CS 261 Assignment1" in the subject.
